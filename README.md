### Overview
Repository with my work on Piscine #7 @42Porto { August / September 2023}

> [!NOTE]
> Below are some useful knowledge to keep you swimming :swimmer: :surfer:

### **Before Exams** <br />
1- You should learn functions loops condition arrays and strings before exam 00 <br />
2- You should Learn argc & argv & malloc and free before exam01/exam02 <br />
3- You Should Learn Makefile Library Header Pointers-Functions before final exam <br />
**You need 25 points to validate any exam** <br />
**You need 50 points to validate the days except rushes and bsq and C09 and C10 which it need 100%** 
# Piscine tips <br />
### **Week1:** Shell00, Shell01, C00, C01 <br />
-Don't Waste your time on shell01 project, you must learn language C And work on C00 and C01, because the exam is on C language. <br />
-Validate Shell01 on weekend and work on this rush because its easy. <br />
### **Week2:** C02, C03, C04, C06 <br />
-It's better to validate C06 before C05, because the exam01 is on argc & argv. <br />
-Dont waste your time on rush01, it's better to work on your days and prepare for exam on weekends and know your mistakes that you made on the previous exams. <br />
### **Week3:** C05, C07, C08, C09 <br />
-Try to improve your code skills and your algorithms. <br />
### **Week4:** C11 <br />
-Don't waste your time on rush02 and BSQ and C10, it's better to validate the previous days with 100% and prepare for the final exam. <br />

 ## :cop: NORMINETTE
 At 42 School, it is expected that almost every project is written in accordance with the Norm, which is the coding standard of the school.
 
 ```
 - No for, do...while, switch, case, goto, ternary operators and variable-length arrays are allowed
 - Each function must be a maximum of 25 lines, not counting the function's curly brackets
 - Each line must be at most 80 columns wide, comments included
 - A function can take 4 named parameters maximum
 - No assigns and declarations in the same line (unless static)
 - You can't declare more than 5 variables per function
 - ...
 ```
