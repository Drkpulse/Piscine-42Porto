# Piscine tips <br />
### **Week1:** Shell00, Shell01, C00, C01 <br />
-don't waste your time on shell01 project, you must learn language C and work on C00 and C01, because the exam is on c Language. <br />
-validate Shell01 on weekend and work on this rush because is so easy. <br />
### **Week2:** C02, C03, C04, C06 <br />
-it's better to validate C06 before C05, because the exam01 is on argc & argv. <br />
-Dont waste your time on rush01, it's better to work on your days and prepare for exam on weekends and know your mistakes that you made on the previous exams. <br />
### **Week3:** C05, C07, C08, C09 <br />
-try to improve your code skills and your algorithms. <br />
### **Week4:** C11 <br />
